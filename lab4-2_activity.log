 PHASE2 !

- python lab4-2_probe.py scanme.nmap.org 22: port  open 
- python lab4-2_probe.py scanme.nmap.org 9999 : port closed (refused)
- python lab4-2_probe.py scanme.nmap.org 119 : port closed (refused)

 PHASE3 !

- workers 50 --timeout 3.0
Scan complete in 2.92s — 2 open ports found

- workers 30 --timeout 1.0
Scan complete in 4.75s — 2 open ports found

- workers 20 --timeout 5.0
Scan complete in 7.11s — 2 open ports found

- --workers 50 --timeout 0.05
Scan complete in 1.08s — 0 open ports found

THE LESS WORKERS, THE MORE SLOWER THE SCAN IS, THE LOWER THE TIMEOUT IS, THE LESS TIME 
THHE SCAN HAS TO DO A THOROUGH SCAN

open ports: 20, 80 

PHASE4 !




Port 20: 
- Banner: [Errno 111] Connection refused
- Service: FTP (port-based assumption)
- Status: Actually CLOSED despite scan showing open

Port 80:
- Banner: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with full Apache server details
- Service: HTTP
- Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
- Status: Definitely OPEN and responsive

Analysis:
- Port 80 provided excellent banner information
- Port 20 appears to be a false positive from the port scan
- HTTP probe was very effective for port 80
- FTP port (20) is actually closed or filtered


PHASE 5 ! 

TASK 5.2 


UDP Probing Challenges Observed:

1. CONNECTIONLESS: No handshake like TCP
   - TCP: (clearly open/closed)
   - UDP: Send packet → Maybe get response (ambiguous)

2. RELIABILITY ISSUES:
   - No reply could mean:
     * Port is closed or filtered by firewall  
     * Service is slow to respond
     * Packet was lost in transit
   

3. DNS EXAMPLE RESULTS:
   - 1.1.1.1: 53 - RESPONDED with hex data (open)
   - 8.8.8.8: 53 - RESPONDED with hex data (open) 
   - scanme.nmap.org: 9999 - no reply :(

4. PROTOCOL DEPENDENCE:
   - DNS responds to both empty and real queries
   - Other services might ignore malformed packets
   - Need proper protocol knowledge for accurate results

5. DEFENSIVE IMPLICATIONS:
   - UDP services harder to scan accurately
   - Firewalls can drop UDP without responses
